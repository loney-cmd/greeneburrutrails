        <h3>Overview and Scenery</h3>
        <p>The Ndabibi River Valley, known as Deep Valley, harbours some of the **most rugged and dramatic scenery** to be found within the Mau Eburu Forest. A hike in this secluded valley, although demanding physically, makes for an **exhilarating adventure experience**.</p>
        <p>Spectacular forest-covered cliffs and bare walls of sheer, exposed rock line both sides of the valley. In places, it is so narrow and deep that only a thin sliver of sky can be seen overhead. This stupendous chasm is the result of aeons of gouging action by the headwaters of the **Ndabibi River**, one of Mau Eburu’s most important water catchments.</p>

        <h3>The Waterfall and Wildlife</h3>
        <p>A walk of about $300\text{ m}$ upstream, between the flanks of the deep, narrowing chasm, leads to the **Deep Valley Waterfall**. The cascading water, tumbling from a rock-shelf high above, falls ten metres or so into a small pool, raising a fine spray.</p>
        <p>The river here is a clear, shallow stream, flowing around moss-covered boulders and shaded by luxuriant **tree-ferns**. Around the pool beneath the waterfall, the spoor of **Mountain Bongos** and of **Giant Forest Hogs** is very often evident.</p>

        <h3>Challenge and Safety ⚠️</h3>
        <p>The terrain is formidable. The ascent/descent is **very steep and challenging**, calling for careful use of available hand- and footholds. In some places, the ground-cover is so dense, there is no obvious route.</p>
        <p>The services of an **experienced leader or guide are essential**. **Waterproof hiking boots are also recommended** due to the sodden turf.</p>
