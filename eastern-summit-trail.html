        <h3>Scenery and Features</h3>
        <p><strong>DRAMATIC upland scenery</strong> and **spectacular, panoramic vistas** of the Great Rift Valley and its flanking walls are features of the Eastern Summit Trail. This summit, as the roof of Mount Eburu, commands magnificent views of **Lake Naivasha and Mount Longonot** to the south-east, and of **Lakes Elmentaita and Nakuru** to the north and north-west.</p>
        <p>Other scenic features include the dramatic depression of the **Keringet Crater**, skirted during the ascent, and the precipitous rock-cliffs overlooking Songoloi, to the north. Near the summit, a large clearing, overseen by a lone *Cussonia spicata* tree festooned in *Usnea* (‘Old Man’s Beard’) lichen, provides the ideal picnic site.</p>

        <h3>Habitats and Wildlife</h3>
        <p>The Trail climbs through dense *Dombeya* forest, interspersed with scattered *Prunus africana* trees. Dominant, along the Trail’s upper reaches, are majestic **Podocarpus trees and thickets of African Mountain Bamboo**.</p>
        <p>In these sheltered habitats, wild animals—including **Harvey’s Red Duikers, Bushbuck, and even Giant Forest Hogs**—may be encountered, while occasionally signs of the elusive **Mountain Bongo** may be found. **Guereza (Black-and-White) Colobus Monkeys** are common in the Bamboo Zone.</p>
        <p>For birdwatching, this trail is very rewarding, particularly for seeing raptors. **Peregrine Falcons** and **Verreaux’s (Black) Eagles** are among the raptor species to look out for.</p>

        <h3>Route Notes and Access ⚠️</h3>
        <p>The Trail is a **$5.2\text{-km}$ circuit** that begins $3.7\text{ km}$ from the Eburu Forest Station. The ascent is a hike of about $3.6\text{ km}$ leading to the summit peak ($2,855\text{ m}$). A $1.6\text{-km}$ descent leads back to Main Forest Road.</p>
        <p><strong>ACCESS:</strong> The Trail begins and ends at different points, so hiking parties wishing to complete the whole circuit may have to get a driver to drop them off and collect them later. The Trail is overgrown in places, and the path may not be obvious. **So it is best to hire a local guide.**</p>
        <p>Caution is called for, however, in that **African Buffaloes** may also be present, resting up in tangled thickets here.</p>
